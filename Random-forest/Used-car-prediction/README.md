# 🚗 Used Cars Selling Price Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features. It uses a **Random Forest Regressor** and includes steps for preprocessing categorical data, training/testing the model, and evaluating its performance.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Used_cars_selling_price_prediction.py` — Main Python script containing the complete workflow:
  - Data loading
  - Preprocessing (encoding)
  - Splitting the dataset
  - Training the model
  - Evaluating the model

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is assumed to be located at:
```

C:/Users/lenyo/Documents/Datasets/Random forest/Used cars.csv

````
Ensure that you update the file path to match your own directory structure before running the script.

### Features:
- Brand
- Year
- Kilometers driven
- Fuel type
- Transmission
- Owner type
- ... (other features, depending on the actual dataset)

### Target:
- Selling price of the car

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
  - `RandomForestRegressor`
  - `train_test_split`
  - `LabelEncoder`, `OneHotEncoder`, `ColumnTransformer`
  - `r2_score`, `mean_squared_error`

## 🔄 Workflow Summary

1. **Load Dataset**: Import data from a CSV file.
2. **Preprocess Data**: Encode categorical features using label and one-hot encoding.
3. **Split Data**: 70% training and 30% testing.
4. **Model Training**: Use a Random Forest Regressor with tuned hyperparameters.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Output R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## 📈 Sample Output

```text
R2 Score: 0.915 (example output)
Mean Squared Error: 116000.0 (example output)

## ✅ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/used-cars-price-prediction.git
   cd used-cars-price-prediction
   ```

2. Make sure you have Python and dependencies installed:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```

3. Update the dataset path in the script (`Used_cars_selling_price_prediction.py`).

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python Used_cars_selling_price_prediction.py
   ```

## 📌 Notes

* For better performance, consider performing additional preprocessing (e.g., handling missing values, feature scaling).
* Model parameters (`n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`) can be tuned for optimal performance.
